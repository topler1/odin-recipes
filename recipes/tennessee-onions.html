    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These Tennessee onions, baked with Cajun seasoning and 3 kinds of cheese, are so tender and sweet. They’re the perfect accompaniment to any meat.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 sweet onions, sliced into 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, cut into 6 slices</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Arrange 1/2 of the onions on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle with half the Cajun seasoning and half the garlic powder. Repeat with remaining onions, seasoning, and garlic powder.</li>
